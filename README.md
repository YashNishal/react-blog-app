# React Blog App

## Introduction
We created a simple and striaghtforward Blog app using react and react routing. It has the features of hot routing, great aesthetics and a crazy-fun Terminal component for attraction purposes. The app contains three pages i.e. Home page (/home) , Blogs page (/blog) and a page for adding a new blog (/add-blog).

The web app is responsive and has support for all standard screen sizes. The home page contains the terminal UI component, the blogs page contains all the blogs in individual expandable cards and the add blog page contains a form with Author, Title and content inputs.

The blogs are stored in a Firebase database hosted on google cloud, and the API calls are being made to the database itself. You can use the APIs of your own database to create a different instance of this app. There are two major API calls i.e. the API call to fetch all the blogs present and the API call to add a new blog to the database.

The preview of mobile version of the app is shown in the below GIF:
